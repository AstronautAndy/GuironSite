I'm using the built-in Python web server for development and testing purposes. I access this by navigating to the project directory via terminal and entering the following command:
python3 -m http.server

On second thought, let's use Node instead. The Python server is apparently very slow.
I already have both node and npm installed, so all I need to do is run the following command from the project directory:
http-server 

I kept the processing sketch directory titled 'Guiron_sketch' both for reference and for testing purposes. I moved  the base code to the JS file 'sketch.js'

They have an example for loading images which proved useful.

I've decided to simplify the scope significantly and remove all interactive elements from this build of the site, as I don't want to obsess over features that I haven't set up the infrastructure for. That and I just want to get this project done so I can move on to the next one. 

The collission detection is shite, but I have a base system that works for what I want it to do. 

The question is: Do I settle for something sheisty (for now) and make it work, or invest more time into having a single product that does exactly what I want it do?
